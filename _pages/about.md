Welcome to my personal website! I'm Curtis and please allow me to introduce myself!

I'm a proud alumnus of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT for short). After graduating and receiving my degree in Software Engineering, I went to work for Chainbridge Technologies designing and developing software solution that allow the US Government to more rapidly and accurately respond to and assess emergency situations. I work hard every day to help save lives!
