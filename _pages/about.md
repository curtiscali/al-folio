Welcome to my personal website! I'm Curtis and please allow me to introduce myself!

I'm a proud alumnus of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT for short). After graduating and receiving my degree in Software Engineering, I went to work for Chainbridge Technologies designing and developing software solution that allow the US Government to more rapidly and accurately respond to and assess emergency situations. I work hard every day to help save lives!

When I'm not working hard to make sure our government has the resources to properly manage emergencies and logistics, I enjoy spending time with my dog, walking, streaming amazing shows, and exploring the beautiful Nevada desert.

If you have any feedback, constructive feedback, or just want to drop me a line, please feel free to do so via any of the socials I link down below, although email or LinkedIn work best for me.
